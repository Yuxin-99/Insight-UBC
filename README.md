# Insight-UBC

Using the Insight-UBC interface, users are able to query information about the courses and locations of buildings, which is quite helpful to people who just arrive at UBC.
For example, users can ask for questions like "What are the computer science courses, taught by Professor XXX, after 2017 that have a mean grade above 80?". And then the interface will display the results of this query.
And the project also provides a rough schedule for an amount of courses where there is no room conflicts between the courses and the rooms of the courses whose lecture time is close are not too far away.
